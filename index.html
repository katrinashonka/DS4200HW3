     Hello! My name is Katrina, I am a third year computer science and sociology student. I am originally from Tampa, Florida, but
     spent my early childhood in Beijing, China from three to eight years old. Growing up between different cultures gave me a
     deep appreciation for global perspectives, which has shaped both my academic interests and personal experiences. After, I
     continued living in Florida before I moved to London to start at Northeastern through the NUin program. I really enjoyed
     living abroad, so I knew for my first co-op that I wanted to work internationally and was able to secure one in Singapore.
     There, I worked on the World Avatar Project doing software development. Even though my major and experience is tech related I
     have always enjoyed art and fashion. In high school, I was an avid oil painter and a couple of years ago I started selling
     style bundles and vintage clothing online. I also enjoy cooking a lot and trying new foods. My friends and I, are always on
     the hunt for a new cafe in Boston with good matcha and pastries. Besides that, I enjoy crocheting a lot. One of my new yearâ€™s
     resolutions is to develop my own patterns. So far, I have learned a new technique called filet crochet and I am working on
     developing a pattern for a lace skirt.
