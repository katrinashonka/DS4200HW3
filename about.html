    <h2>About Oil Painting</h2>
  </header>

  <section>
    <p>
      I began oil painting in middle school as a hobby. I had taken art classes and attended camps, but never had an opportunity
      to work with it formally. Seeing oil paintings in museums and videos online, I was intrigued and decided to pursue it in my
      free time. I started by painting portraits of my friends and realized that it was something I enjoyed doing very much. When
      I entered high school, I had the opportunity to explore art more broadly. I tried out many different mediums such as wire,
      colored pencil, watercolor and acrylic but oil painting remained my favorite. In my junior year, I developed my skills more
      seriously in the process creating my portfolio for the AP 2D Art exam. Then, I discovered that I had a pretty backwards
      process for painting in oil. I learned the proper way to go about it and was able to submit my artwork to competitions and
      some of my work was housed in museums. Since entering college, I have continued to paint in my free time and explore art
      through museums. When I travel I try to sketch but oil is still my favorite medium. Some of my favorite artists are Lucian
      Freud, Norman Rockwell, and Kateryna Bilokur. They each have heavily inspired my work.

    <h3>Key Steps in an Oil Painting Process:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1. Develop a sketch and source of inspiration.</li>
      <li>2. Identify key colors in your painting and mix them.</li>
      <li>3. Prepare your canvas with a layer of gesso. Let it dry. </li>
      <li>4. Create your underpainting by using a thinned out key color to map 
      important shapes, light and dark values. </output>/li>
      <li>5. Begin oil painting in earnest. Start with the background! (I always did this last)</li>
      <li>6. Let the painting dry completely and then add a varnish. </li>
    </ul>
